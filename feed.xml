<figure>“A mother shared with us that her daughter gathered up some of the confetti that we shot when her older brother got his first card. Now the little girl keeps it in her pocket because it’s special. Everyone who happens to be in the library at the time end up smiling and cheering with us for our newest patron. It’s simply joyful.”

An interesting meeting of libraries and local shared mobility, in this case via a commercial partner. "Showcasing the library’s commitment to helping their communities with a range of resources" as they put it. Good write-up too.</p>
<figure>“In keeping with the practice of naming the library-based Zipcars after literary and pop-culture figures, the two Zipcars available at Kings Bay are named Joan Rivers and Lou Reed.”

                    I wrote about a few transit-library partnerships. Here's a similar one with two university partners. Brigham Young University and Utah Valley University are providing free Provo-Orem transit passes to all of their students and employees — plus their spouses and dependents - for ten years.

Combined, free passes will be given to more than 100,000 people annually.</p>
<figure>“Holland said the UVU contract will be covered by reallocating a combination of existing revenue, including the existing UTA student fee fund, employee benefits funding, and parking pass revenue. UVU will increase the cost of an annual parking pass from $90 to $115 to help cover the cost; however, current student fees will not increase.”</figure>

<p>Love seeing smart efforts like this to redirect spending on parking into general mobility. Don't know that the university libraries have a role in this project, but have in others.</p>

                <p>Mobility is an important part of local access and I looked at a number of related library programs -- some that make transit access a part of library membership, some others that work with communities on "Safe Routes" programs.</p>
<p>Here's a project in Boise, ID, partnered with Safe Routes there, this year <a href="http://mailchi.mp/boisebicycleproject/thank-you-for-making-this-the-best-christmas-kids-bike-giveaway-yet" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">giving refurbished bikes to 320 kids</a>. No library involvement that I'm aware of. But as libraries have looked for ways to support biking, this seems promising. Could also imagine it having a circulating aspect: "take a free kids bike, please return it to the program when you outgrow it". It's a big undertaking, but consistent with librarians' skills organizing partners and working with volunteers.</p>

                <p>Here's one I missed for the Placemakers chapter. In Red Hook, NY, the library conducted a Libraries Transforming Communities <a href="http://www.ala.org/tools/librariestransform/libraries-transforming-communities/case-studies/redhook">engagement process</a>. The timing of the one stoplight in town was a known issue and irritant but the engagement process identified it a top priority for the community. That it had been in need of fixing for years had further contributed to poor attitudes about the civic process there.</p>
<figure>
<p>“To have someone ask them what they thought and listen to what they had to say— that was very powerful.The stoplight was a pretty popular response to these questions,” Kovalchik said. “People wanted safe, walkable space and also a vibrant, economically viable village.”</p>

<p><span style="color: var(--text-editor-body-color); font-family: var(--font-base); font-size: inherit; font-weight: var(--font-weight-normal);">The library was able to lend its expertise to help the community and local officials coordinate calls and letter writing to state agencies to get the stoplight fixed. That's the library using its particular skills and status to strengthen community-based placemaking, to improve access to shaping the physical facts of the town.</span></p>

<p>It's available as an iCal feed, of course, and can be easily added to your personal calendar app of choice.</p>
<p>This is a calendar mode I didn't discuss at all! Curating thematic, sharable calendars ad hoc. Lots of creative things libraries could do with this, and we don't even need to use our own strained event calendars to do so. Could do the whole thing in Google Calendar, and create multiple thematic calendars under one account. The Awesomeville Literary Calendar. The Awesomeville Library Advocacy Calendar. The Awesomeville Know Your Rights Calendar. The Awesomeville Early Learning Calendar.</p>
<p>Anyone know of something like this being done already?</p>
